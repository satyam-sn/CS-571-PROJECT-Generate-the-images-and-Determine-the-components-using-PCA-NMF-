# CS-571-PROJECT-Generate-the-images-and-Determine-the-components-using-PCA-NMF-
PROBLEM
1.Generate the images as described .
2.Determine the components using PCA, NMF and dictionary learning. Check corresponding  functions sklearn.decomposition. DictionaryLearning, sklearn.decomposition.PCA, sklearn.decomposition.NMF
3.Compare the results and see if the underlying (clean) images can be reproduced.
USEFULNESS-
This problem is useful because PCA is an unsupervised linear dimensionality reduction algorithm to find a more meaningful basis or coordinate system for our data and works based on a covariance matrix to find the strongest features of your samples.
so, This project emphasis on how an important component of image can be recognised from the noisy set of image with help of various techniques which majorly focuses on decomposition of image which is represented in the form of array. Approach to analysis is that it uses dimensionality reduction and linear algebra concepts to recognize images. This approach is computationally less expensive and easy to implement and thus used in various applications at that time such as image recognition.
